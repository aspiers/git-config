# Hmm.  This is a good example of why people sometimes complain that
# the git porcelain is ugly.

# Parsing porcelain is an ugly approach because it couples the
# solution to the formatting which could change:
#git branch | awk '$1 == "*" { print $2 }'

# And this one only works with git >= 1.6.3:
#git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD

# The lesser of three evils:
git symbolic-ref HEAD | sed 's,refs/heads/,,'
