suggested options:

    -c cherry-menu.redo-upstreamed=true
          Include commits which are annotated has having been
          previously upstreamed with a different patch-id.  This can
          be useful if you decide to hard-reset the upstream branch in
          order to redo some cherry-picking you made a mess of, but
          want to be able to reuse the notes which were created the
          first time round.

    -c cherry-menu.skip-todos=true
          Skip commits which have notes including 'TODO'.  This allows
          unresolved upstreaming tasks to be tracked via an external
          issue tracker without getting in the way during repeated
          runs of cherry-menu.

COMMAND is typically "git icing -v2" or "git cherry" but can be
anything which gives output in the same format, e.g.

    git icing -v2 \$upstream \$downstream | grep ... > tmpfile
    # Could edit tmpfile here if we want
    $me cat tmpfile

Provides an interactive wrapper around git-icing (or git cherry).  For
each commit provided on STDIN by COMMAND which has not yet been
upstreamed, asks the user whether they want to cherry-pick the commit,
blacklist it, or skip it.  After a successful cherry-pick, the source
commit will be automatically blacklisted if the patch-id changed.

You can quit the process at any time and safely re-run it later - it
will resume from where you left off.

Invoking icing with "-v2" ensures that previously blacklisted /
upstreamed commits are also processed.
