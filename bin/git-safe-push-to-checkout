# Smarter push-to-checkout hook for when receive.denyCurrentBranch is
# set to updateInstead.  It's near-identical to git's default
# behaviour when no push-to-checkout hook is provided; however it
# additionally bails if we have emacs lockfiles indicating edits in
# progress for files which would be changed by the push-to-checkout.
#
# This means that push-to-checkout works more safely and doesn't rewrite
# files which are currently being edited in emacs with unsaved changes.
